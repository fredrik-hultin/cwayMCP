# Changes Made - Remove Fake Data Simulation

## Summary
Removed all fake data simulation functionality from the dashboard to ensure it only shows real data from the MCP server.

## Changes Made

### 1. WebSocket Service (`client/src/services/websocketService.ts`)
- ‚úÖ **Removed** `startSimulation()` method that was generating fake log and flow data
- ‚úÖ **Added** `onDisconnect()` callback mechanism to notify when connection is lost
- ‚úÖ **Added** `removeDisconnectCallback()` for cleanup
- ‚úÖ **Improved** disconnect detection to trigger callbacks when server goes down

### 2. Dashboard Component (`client/src/components/SimpleDashboard.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ **Added** disconnect event listener to update UI when server disconnects
- ‚úÖ **Improved** connection status handling

### 3. Start Script (`start-dashboard.sh`)
- ‚úÖ **Created** convenient script to start both backend and frontend together
- ‚úÖ Includes pre-flight checks for .env, venv, and node_modules
- ‚úÖ Provides colored output and helpful access point information
- ‚úÖ Handles graceful shutdown of both servers with Ctrl+C

## Behavior Now

### When Server is Running ‚úÖ
- Dashboard shows: **"Connected to MCP Server"** (green)
- Real-time data flows in from WebSocket
- Flow visualization shows actual requests
- Logs display real server activity

### When Server is Down ‚ùå  
- Dashboard shows: **"Disconnected - Start MCP server to see real data"** (red)
- No fake data is displayed
- No simulated flows or logs
- Clear message instructing user to start the server
- Auto-reconnect attempts every 10 seconds

## Connection Status Indicators

| Status | Icon | Color | Message |
|--------|------|-------|---------|
| Connected | üü¢ Wifi | Green | "Connected to MCP Server" |
| Connecting | üü° Wifi (pulse) | Yellow | "Connecting..." |
| Disconnected | üî¥ WifiOff | Red | "Disconnected - Start MCP server..." |

## How to Start

### Option 1: Single Command (Recommended)
```bash
./start-dashboard.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual (Two Terminals)
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd server && python main.py --mode dashboard

# Terminal 2  
cd client && npm start
```

## Access Points
- React Dashboard: http://localhost:3001
- WebSocket Server: http://localhost:8080
- Health Check: http://localhost:8080/health

## Testing
To verify the changes work correctly:

1. Start only the React client (not the backend)
   ```bash
   cd client && npm start
   ```
   - Dashboard should show "Disconnected" status
   - No data should appear

2. Start the backend server
   ```bash
   cd server && python main.py --mode dashboard
   ```
   - Dashboard should automatically connect within 10 seconds
   - Status should change to "Connected"
   - Real data should start flowing

3. Stop the backend server (Ctrl+C)
   - Dashboard should detect disconnect
   - Status should change to "Disconnected"
   - Log entry should show: "‚ö†Ô∏è Disconnected from MCP server"

## Benefits
- ‚úÖ No confusion between real and fake data
- ‚úÖ Clear feedback when server is not running
- ‚úÖ Users know exactly what they need to do
- ‚úÖ More reliable for testing actual server functionality
- ‚úÖ Cleaner codebase without simulation logic
